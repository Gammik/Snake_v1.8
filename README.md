# Snake_v1.8
Update for Snake game
## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible without running into walls or yourself.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Food items: The snake can eat food items that appear on the screen to grow longer and earn points.
- Obstacles: Be careful not to run into walls or the snake's own body, as this will result in a game over.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of your score, which increases every time you eat a piece of food.
- Game over screen: When the game is over, you can see your final score and choose to play again.
